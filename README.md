# cw-codingdojo
This repository, for different technologies, provides the skeletons for setting up the minimum necessary environments for running and testing code. For each available language there is a folder containing the necessary files and a README with instructions.

## How to contribute
Once you have choosen the kata you want to solve and the language you want to use, **before starting to code**, use these two commands to create a personal space for your solution:
```
cd <kata-name>
cp -r ../<choosen-language> <your-names>
```
When you have finished, you can follow the normal CW procedure to add your solution to the repo.

Once we start with the first codingDojo you will see more and more excercises available to be solved.

**Please do not modify the languange template folders**
